The AI engineer's trajectory showcases a complex debugging and feature implementation process. Initially, the focus was on delivering a comprehensive Exchange feature within the customer return form, involving both backend API development and a detailed frontend UI, including dynamic elements and animations. This feature was successfully implemented and confirmed.

Subsequently, the core of the work shifted to resolving persistent and multifaceted Shopify integration issues. These included fixing OAuth redirect problems (incorrect redirect URIs, state parameter issues, hardcoded tenant IDs), ensuring robust data backfill (orders, returns), and maintaining dynamic display of connection status and synchronized counts. The engineer systematically tackled problems like database field mismatches, conflicting API routes, non-persistent encryption keys, and crucially, Shopify app permission limitations, leading to a pivot to GraphQL for data fetching. The work concludes with the implementation of GraphQL for data fetching, but the permission issue with Shopify remains, necessitating a user action or a complete GraphQL rewrite for all data.

The application is a multi-tenant Returns Management SaaS for e-commerce, primarily integrating with Shopify. It requires distinct customer and merchant portals, with Shopify OAuth for merchant onboarding (auto-provisioning tenant, saving tokens, registering webhooks, 90-day data backfill, redirect to dashboard). A strict Tenant Management System allows admins to create tenants with associated merchant users. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is essential. The Main Portal () is a fixed merchant destination.

Key features implemented or in progress include:
1.  **Comprehensive Policy Management System**: A functional rules/workflow engine, configurable via UI, covering policy zones, return windows, product eligibility, return outcomes (refunds, exchanges, store credit), advanced workflow automation, fraud detection, shipping, communication, reporting, and integrations. The backend for this system is largely complete, and a comprehensive frontend UI was recently implemented.
2.  **Customer Return Form Exchange Feature**: This feature adds Exchange as a resolution option with sub-flows for selecting replacement products/variants, real-time availability, and price difference handling. The merchant dashboard should show Exchange Requested, allowing approval (triggering new Shopify order). Confirmation emails for customers. Exchange eligibility is governed by merchant rules. The customer form should also have a floating effect. This feature's backend and frontend implementation are now complete.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into resolving critical Shopify integration issues. The Exchange feature, including its backend APIs (, ) and comprehensive frontend UI (, , , ), had been successfully implemented and confirmed.

The focus then shifted entirely to the Shopify integration, specifically addressing problems that prevented real order and return data from syncing. Key issues tackled include:
1.  **Shopify OAuth Flow**: Debugging persistent failures where the app would redirect to the dashboard but not register as connected. This involved:
    *   Fixing a double domain issue in the Shopify install URL.
    *   Correcting hardcoded tenant IDs and ensuring the OAuth flow uses the *existing* tenant's ID by passing it via URL parameters and embedding it in the OAuth state.
    *   Resolving an  error caused by a non-persistent encryption key by adding  to the  file.
    *   Fixing user creation during OAuth to use the standard  model, resolving an uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) error.
    *   Resolving conflicts between  and  due to duplicate routes, ensuring the correct, comprehensive status endpoint is hit.
2.  **Dynamic Data Display and Cleanup**: Ensuring order and return counts dynamically reflect the Shopify connection status (showing zero when disconnected, real data when connected). This involved:
    *   Updating backend logic to filter orders/returns by source (, ) for counts.
    *   Enhancing the disconnect functionality to thoroughly clean up all associated Shopify orders and returns from the database. A  endpoint was also added for manual data reset.
3.  **Shopify API Permissions**: The most recent and critical roadblock. Despite successful OAuth and integration status, real order and return data were not syncing. The logs revealed a  error: This app is not approved to access REST endpoints with protected customer data. This is an external Shopify Partner Dashboard configuration issue. As a temporary workaround, the engineer started modifying the data backfill and connection test logic to use Shopify's **GraphQL API** for fetching orders and returns.

The current state is that the  endpoint is being updated to use GraphQL to verify the connection, while the core issue of Shopify app permission for protected customer data remains.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to test the updated  endpoint to confirm if the GraphQL-based data fetching for Shopify orders is working, given the Shopify API permission limitations.
