The AI engineer's work transitioned from stabilizing the core multi-tenant SaaS application (returns, Shopify sync, performance) to implementing a robust user management system and, most recently, a comprehensive tenant management system. Initial efforts resolved critical issues like duplicate data, N+1 queries, and real-time Shopify synchronization. A significant phase involved building a production-ready user management system with email/password and Google OAuth. This required extensive backend development (models, services, controllers) and initial frontend UI. Challenges included Google OAuth redirect URI mismatches and persistent React infinite re-render loops in the authentication flow, which were meticulously debugged and fixed. The current work has progressed to building a strict tenant isolation system, with the backend fully implemented and tested, and frontend component creation for tenant management and merchant signup currently underway.

The application is a multi-tenant Returns Management SaaS platform for e-commerce, primarily integrating with Shopify. It streamlines return processes for merchants and customers, offering a customer-facing portal and a merchant dashboard. Key features include Shopify OAuth, real-time order/return sync, a configurable rules engine, AI suggestions, label issuance, email notifications, and analytics, all built with strict multi-tenancy. The Elite-Grade Returns Creation system supports Shopify and local database order lookups, policy previews, and detailed return APIs. User stories cover customer-initiated returns, merchant review, manual creation, automated decisions, live data sync, label/refund processing, and robust security.

Recently, the scope expanded to a complete user management structure with Google OAuth. The latest requirement focuses on a strict Tenant Management System. Admins need to create tenants quickly, each with a unique  and  (later changed to  for merchant signup). Merchants sign up using this , claiming the tenant. RBAC is lightweight: admins manage tenants, merchants see only their data. The system must enforce zero data leakage between tenants, show empty states for unconnected stores (e.g., without Shopify), and maintain end-to-end tenant boundaries across API, DB, webhooks, jobs, and UI.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing a complete, production-ready user management structure, including login with Google too easily, and subsequently, a new Strict Tenant Isolation + Empty States for Unconnected Stores system.

The **User Management System** work initially focused on:
-   **Backend**: Completed with new  and  MongoDB collections, schemas (), indexes (), core services (, ), and FastAPI controllers (). Environment variables for authentication (SECRET_KEY, Google OAuth credentials) were added.
-   **Frontend**: Initial React components for , , , , , and  were created.

During testing, several critical issues were encountered and resolved:
-   **Google OAuth Redirect URI Mismatch (Error 400)**: Fixed by modifying  to handle dynamic redirect URIs and providing the user with detailed instructions () to update their Google Cloud Console configuration.
-   **White Screen / Infinite Loop after Login**: This was a persistent issue stemming from React's rendering logic, primarily in  and redirect handling in . Multiple attempts were made, and the  was called, leading to a comprehensive refactor of  and adjustments to redirect paths ( vs. ) and the creation of . The issue was ultimately resolved by ensuring  correctly integrates with  and handles redirects based on user role.
-   **Missing Logout Functionality**: Added a Log out option to the  component, leveraging the  for state management.
-   **Inconsistent Frontend URL**: Provided instructions to the user () to clear browser cache and localStorage, as the issue was client-side caching of old URLs like .

Following the stabilization of the core authentication, the AI engineer received new detailed requirements for the **Tenant Management System**:
-   **Backend (Phase 1 Complete)**: New models (), enhanced services (), and controllers ( for admin,  for merchant signup) have been created. New middleware (, ) was implemented and registered in  to enforce strict multi-tenancy and provide empty states for unconnected stores. A new database initialization script () was created and run to add necessary indexes for  collection. Numerous import, service initialization, and index creation syntax errors were debugged and fixed to make the backend fully functional and robust, integrating with the existing user management.
-   **Frontend (Phase 2 Initiated)**: The AI engineer has just begun creating the frontend components for the tenant management system. This includes  for API interaction, UI components like , , , and core pages such as  (for admin) and  (for public signup). Empty state components (, , ) have also been created. The immediate next step is to update  to incorporate these new routes and components.
