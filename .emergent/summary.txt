The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on an e-commerce Returns Management SaaS platform. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing the Shopify integration, which involved pivoting to GraphQL for data sync, fixing OAuth flow issues (persistent encryption keys, tenant ID, optional HMAC/timestamp in callbacks), and resolving  errors in data processing. The Exchange feature within the customer return flow was completed.

Subsequently, the engineer addressed critical bugs in the customer return form, specifically order not found and submit request not working, tracing issues to incorrect API calls, disabled routers, and strict date validation. The AI introduced, then removed, temporary demo pages based on user feedback, ultimately fixing the original customer return form.

The conversation then shifted to implementing a comprehensive Form Branding and Configuration system for merchants. This involved creating new frontend components and backend controllers for customization, handling public access for customer-facing forms (bypassing tenant isolation middleware for specific routes), and resolving complex React hook errors and API routing conflicts (e.g.,  prefixing). A significant challenge was ensuring correct tenant detection and data isolation across both customer-facing forms and merchant configuration UIs, especially when dealing with logged-in merchant sessions versus public access. The work culminated in partially functional form customization, with persistent issues around tenant context in the merchant UI despite successful customer-facing form behavior.

The application is a multi-tenant Returns Management SaaS platform for e-commerce, primarily integrated with Shopify, offering distinct customer and merchant portals. Merchant onboarding includes Shopify OAuth for tenant provisioning, token saving, webhook registration, and a 90-day data backfill. A Tenant Management System provides RBAC for administrators to manage tenants and merchant users.

Key features implemented or in progress:
1.  **Comprehensive Policy Management System**: UI-configurable rules engine for return policies (zones, windows, product eligibility, outcomes, fraud detection, shipping, communication, reporting). Backend is largely complete, and a comprehensive frontend UI was recently implemented.
2.  **Customer Return Form Exchange Feature**: Integrates an Exchange option in the customer return flow. This includes product/variant selection, real-time availability, price difference handling, and displaying Exchange Requested statuses in the merchant dashboard, triggering new Shopify orders upon approval. Confirmation emails are sent, and eligibility is policy-governed. The customer form also features floating UI effects. This feature's backend and frontend implementation are now complete.
3.  **Form Branding & Configuration (New Priority)**: Merchants need a settings section to customize their customer return forms. This includes:
    *   **Branding**: Logo upload (with preview), favicon, primary/secondary/background/text colors, font family.
    *   **Layout & Theme**: Layout presets (wizard vs. compact), corner radius, spacing density, optional custom CSS (Pro tier, size limits + sanitation).
    *   **Form Configuration**: Toggle fields (phone, photos, notes), custom questions, reasons list, resolution options (refund/exchange/store credit), return window, policy text.
    *   **Preview & Publish**: Live preview (iframe), save draft, publish (versioned configs with rollback).
    *   **Links & Embed**: Show tenant-specific URLs (), universal URLs (), and embed snippets.
    This functionality must reside under Settings in the main merchant dashboard. Configuration must persist per tenant in the database, with styling driven by this config and safe CSS handling. It must work end-to-end for at least one live tenant.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on the Form Branding and Configuration system under the merchant dashboard settings. This involved extensive work on both frontend and backend.

**Backend Status:**
-   New controllers (, , ) were created to manage and expose form configurations.
-   The  was specifically created to provide a public endpoint () accessible by customer-facing forms without authentication or tenant context middleware, requiring modifications to  and .
-   Fixes were implemented for import errors ( vs ) in new controllers.
-   A critical routing issue ( prefixing) in  was resolved.
-   The Invalid order date error during return submission was addressed by making date validation more lenient in .

**Frontend Status:**
-   A new  page was created under merchant settings () providing a UI for branding, layout, form fields, preview, and links/embeds.
-   This page was integrated into the merchant navigation ().
-   The core customer return form () was extensively modified to:
    -   Dynamically detect the tenant from the URL (e.g., ).
    -   Fetch form configurations from the new public backend endpoint.
    -   Apply dynamic styling (colors, fonts) based on fetched configuration or a fallback.
    -   Resolve complex React Hooks issues (conditional hook calls) and variable scope problems to ensure correct tenant ID is used for all API calls.
-   The  component was updated to correctly submit returns via the .

**Current State & Issues:**
-   **Customer Return Forms:** Fully functional and correctly detecting tenant IDs from URLs (). API calls for orders now use the correct tenant, and data isolation is confirmed.
-   **Form Customization UI ():** The UI is built, but it's currently displaying URLs and config for a default tenant () even when the user is logged in as another tenant (). This indicates an issue with the  component incorrectly retrieving or displaying the current logged-in tenant's context, likely due to  being null in some scenarios.
-   **API Issue:** The public form configuration endpoint () is still returning HTML instead of JSON when accessed externally, suggesting a persistent frontend routing/reverse proxy issue catching the public backend endpoint. However, the frontend components (CustomerStart.jsx) are built with fallback configurations, so the form remains functional despite this API issue.
