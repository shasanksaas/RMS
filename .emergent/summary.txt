The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Returns Management SaaS MVP from inception to a functional state, focusing on critical modules and external integrations. Initially, the work centered on building a robust Rules module with a multi-step builder and dynamic logic. The transition then moved to developing a unified Create Return form for both admin and customer portals, with significant backend and frontend scaffolding completed. The most recent and challenging phase involved a comprehensive Shopify OAuth integration and subsequent data surfacing. This phase was characterized by meticulous debugging of  mismatches,  environment variable configurations,  issues, and crucially,  inconsistencies between frontend and backend calls. The engineer systematically addressed these by introducing dynamic environment detection and correcting hardcoded values and tenant ID usage, ensuring a robust, environment-agnostic setup.

The overarching goal is a production-grade, multi-tenant Returns Management SaaS, initially integrated with Shopify. Key features include Shopify OAuth, real-time order/return data synchronization, a shopper return portal, a configurable rules engine, AI suggestions, label issuing, email notifications, analytics, and Stripe billing. Strict multi-tenancy via  is paramount, alongside a responsive React frontend. The MVP transitioned from mock to live Shopify data, establishing core merchant/customer portals and a functional returns system. Previous work focused on a comprehensive Rules module and its integration. The immediate, detailed requirement was to build a unified Create Return form usable by both admin and customer, fully integrated with Shopify, policy enforcement, and backend APIs. The current focus is on surfacing real Shopify data (Orders, Returns, Customers) across the app and ensuring robust OAuth connectivity and data synchronization.

*   : Merchant returns list. Modified to add a Create Return button.
*   : Integrations settings. Heavily modified to fetch and display real Shopify connection status, handle manual resync, simplify the form (removing client-side API key/secret input), and display dynamic data (timestamps, counts, webhook health). Crucially, the tenant ID handling was fixed to match the backend.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the primary focus was on implementing the comprehensive Shopify OAuth integration and subsequently surfacing real Shopify data throughout the application.

The work for the unified Create Return form has already seen backend API scaffolding and frontend step components created. The next step identified for this feature was to create the necessary routes and integrate the frontend components.

For Shopify integration, the AI engineer made significant progress:
1.  **Shopify OAuth Flow**: The backend was enhanced to handle the complete OAuth install and callback flow. This involved modifying  and  to build the Shopify authorization URL, verify HMAC and state, exchange code for access tokens, and persist encrypted tokens per tenant.
2.  **Environment Agnostic Configuration**: A new module, , was created to dynamically detect the  (including Emergent preview URLs) and load  and  from environment variables, removing hardcoded values and making the system deployment-agnostic. The  was updated to initialize this configuration and allow  and  endpoints to bypass tenant validation.
3.  **Backend Data Endpoints**: New controllers were scaffolded for Shopify integration status (), enhanced orders (), and enhanced returns (). These were registered in , with old inline order routes commented out to avoid conflicts.
4.  **Frontend Integration Page ()**: This page was significantly refactored to:
    *   Fetch connection status from .
    *   Simplify the connection form to only require the Shopify shop domain (API keys/secrets are now server-side).
    *   Display the connection status, shop domain, installation/sync timestamps, order/return counts, webhook health, and a Resync button.
    *   **Crucially, a major issue where the frontend was using an incorrect hardcoded tenant ID ( instead of ) was identified and fixed, resolving the visual update issue after successful OAuth connection.**
5.  **Troubleshooting**: Extensive debugging cycles addressed 405 Method Not Allowed errors (due to  sending HEAD requests),  mismatches (fixed by ensuring exact matching  and  in both code and Shopify Partner Dashboard settings, including removing  versions), and  mismatches.
6.  **Current State**: The Shopify OAuth flow is fully functional, and the Integrations page now correctly displays the connected store's status and data counts (currently zeros for a new store, indicating successful connection but no backfill yet). The next immediate task is to update the Orders and Returns pages to also use the correct tenant ID and display real data.
