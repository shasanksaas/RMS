The AI engineer successfully built a multi-tenant Returns Management SaaS MVP in several phases. Initially, it established a FastAPI backend and React frontend, implementing core functionalities like return creation, a rules engine, and analytics. It swiftly addressed critical multi-tenancy issues by fixing tenant ID header handling. Subsequently, the backend was rigorously refactored into a modular architecture, improving maintainability and scalability, and a customer-facing portal was integrated. Most recently, the focus shifted to enhancing the MVP with real Shopify OAuth integration (using provided credentials), and preparing for additional features like AI suggestions, email notifications, label issuing, and Stripe billing. The engineer also proactively set up mock data for offline fallback, demonstrating forward-thinking for a robust application. The current state reflects a functional, modular application, with the foundation laid for remaining third-party integrations.

<product_requirements>
The goal is a production-grade, multi-tenant Returns Management SaaS MVP, initially integrating with Shopify. The system must be modular, fully documented, and scalable. Key features include Shopify OAuth, order synchronization, a shopper-facing return creation portal, a configurable rules engine, AI suggestions, label issuing, email notifications, an analytics dashboard, Stripe billing, admin settings, client portals, and a super admin dashboard. The chosen tech stack is FastAPI (Python) for the backend, React/Next.js with Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and MongoDB as the database. Multi-tenancy must be strictly enforced via  at the database level. Frontend requires a modern, clean UI inspired by Notion/Linear, with full responsiveness and accessibility. Mock Shopify integration was initially required for development without live credentials, with a clear path to real integration. Current implementation includes a functional multi-tenant returns system, analytics, and basic customer/merchant portals, with Shopify integration partially complete and other advanced features prepared with placeholders.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Multi-Tenancy:** Isolation via  and middleware for data security.
-   **Modular Architecture:** Backend structured into controllers, services, models for scalability.
-   **RESTful API Design:** FastAPI for robust and documented API endpoints.
-   **Shopify Integration:** OAuth 2.0 for merchant authentication and webhooks for data synchronization.
-   **Rules Engine:** Deterministic, JSON-based processing for return policies.
-   **Offline Fallback:** Capability to use mock data when external APIs are unavailable.
-   **Modern UI/UX:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI for premium user experience.

The application features a FastAPI backend and a React/Next.js frontend, utilizing MongoDB for data persistence.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes Summary:**

-   : Transformed from a monolithic file into the main application entry point. It now orchestrates the FastAPI application, registering routers from various modules (e.g., , , , , ). It handles CORS and dependency injection.
-   : This new, modular directory structure significantly improves code organization.
    -   : Contains sub-modules like , , , , and . Each module has its own  (API endpoints),  (business logic), and  (data schemas). This separation enforces clear responsibilities and aids scalability.
    -   : Configures Shopify API settings, handling credentials and API versions.
    -   : Centralizes all Shopify API interactions, abstracting away details for order/product sync and OAuth handling, supporting both real and mock modes.
    -   , , : Placeholder services created for future integration of email notifications, AI suggestions, and report generation, respectively.
    -   : Manages FastAPI dependencies, crucial for injecting common resources like  for multi-tenancy.
-   : Now acts as the primary routing component. It integrates the dashboard, returns, settings, the newly developed , and  components, ensuring a cohesive user experience.
-   : A new React component developed to provide a dedicated self-service portal for shoppers to manage their returns.
-   : A UI component to manage Shopify app installation and settings within the merchant dashboard.
-   : A container component designed to house the UI for newly integrated features such as AI suggestions, email settings, and report exports.
-    & : These files store environment-specific configurations and sensitive API keys (e.g., Shopify, OpenAI, Resend, AWS S3, Stripe), crucial for external integrations.
-   : A new directory housing JSON files (, ) that serve as mock responses for Shopify API calls, enabling offline development and testing of Shopify-dependent features.
-   : Organized into , , and  directories. Backend unit tests for services have been added, and the structure is ready for comprehensive test coverage.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was actively working on integrating the application with real Shopify credentials and setting up the infrastructure for new features, while ensuring offline fallback capabilities.

**Key achievements in the immediate past:**
-   **Shopify Integration:** The real Shopify OAuth flow was initiated. New files like  were created to handle the OAuth process. The existing Shopify controller was updated to utilize this new real integration logic.
-   **Mock Data Setup:** A  directory was created, populated with  and . This is crucial for developing and testing Shopify-dependent features in an offline or mock environment, ensuring the UI and workflows behave identically without live API access.
-   **New Feature Services (Placeholders):** Services for , , and  were created within . These serve as placeholders, ready to be integrated with actual third-party APIs (Resend, OpenAI, for example) once the necessary API keys are provided. A corresponding  was created to expose these functionalities.
-   **Frontend Integration of New Features:** The main  was updated to include new UI components like  and . These components provide the user interface for managing Shopify integration settings and accessing the new enhanced features.
-   **Environment Configuration:** The  file was updated with placeholders for all anticipated API keys, including Shopify, OpenAI, Resend, AWS S3, and Stripe, streamlining future integration efforts.
-   **Dependency Management & Debugging:** Necessary Python packages for new features were added to  and installed. The engineer also resolved several critical import errors in the backend and a frontend compilation error related to  icons, ensuring the application remained functional after extensive refactoring.

The last action recorded was the preparation to create production-ready services for label issuing, billing, and enhanced notifications, directly addressing the next set of requirements in the user's latest prompt.
