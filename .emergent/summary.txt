The AI engineer's work transitioned from foundational multi-tenancy and user management setup to addressing critical regressions and implementing core features. Initially, focus was on fixing admin login, real-time tenant management, and restoring  integrity, alongside resolving a customer return form redirect issue by removing .

Subsequently, efforts shifted to a dual-path login UI, troubleshooting frontend caching,  issues, and addressing severe security flaws like hardcoded tenant IDs and admin portal accessibility. Shopify integration became paramount, involving real data backfill, webhook processing, and resolving persistent OAuth routing conflicts and external Shopify app configuration (e.g., , CSRF).

The immediate preceding work involved troubleshooting a  due to conflicting backend API routers, which was successfully resolved. Following this, the engineer tackled persistent Shopify OAuth redirect issues by fixing session handling and frontend token processing. Most recently, a comprehensive policy management system was implemented with a detailed UI, and the engineer has now begun work on adding an Exchange feature to the customer return form, starting with backend API development.

<product_requirements>
The application is a multi-tenant Returns Management SaaS for e-commerce, primarily integrating with Shopify. It requires distinct customer and merchant portals, Shopify OAuth for merchant onboarding (auto-provisioning tenant, saving tokens, registering webhooks, 90-day data backfill, redirect to ). A strict Tenant Management System allows admins to create tenants with associated merchant users. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is essential. The Main Portal () is a fixed merchant destination.
Recent requirements include:
1.  **Comprehensive Policy Management System**: A fully functional rules/workflow engine, configurable via UI, covering:
    *   Policy zones (countries, states, postal codes, warehouses, labels, customs).
    *   Return window configurations (standard, extended, category/price-based).
    *   Product eligibility/exclusions (tags, categories, conditions, value-based, age, quantity).
    *   Return outcomes/resolutions (refunds, exchanges, store credit, keep item, shop now), with detailed sub-settings for each.
    *   Advanced workflow automation (conditional logic based on customer, order, product, return, temporal attributes; various actions like auto-approve/reject, fees, notifications).
    *   Fraud detection (AI models, behavioral patterns, blocklist management, fraud actions).
    *   Shipping & Logistics (label generation, return methods, packaging, tracking).
    *   Communication & Notifications (customizable email templates, SMS).
    *   Reporting & Analytics (dashboard metrics, custom reports, predictive analytics).
    *   Integrations (ecommerce, ERP, inventory, customer service, email marketing, logistics, payment processors).
2.  **Customer Return Form Exchange Feature**: Add Exchange as a resolution option with sub-flows for selecting replacement products/variants, real-time availability, price difference handling. Merchant dashboard should show Exchange Requested, allowing approval (triggering new Shopify order). Confirmation emails for customers. Exchange eligibility must be governed by merchant rules. The form should also have a floating effect.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing the comprehensive Policy Management System and then pivoted to the Exchange feature for the customer return form.

The Policy Management System was successfully implemented on the backend (, , new utils like , , , ), with successful backend API testing achieving 95.2% success rate. A basic frontend UI () was created and integrated into the merchant navigation (, ). The user, however, explicitly stated that the basic UI was insufficient and requested a much more detailed policy management interface that includes ALL the configurations. The engineer then proceeded to implement a comprehensive UI for Policy Management in  with all detailed configuration sections.

Following this, the user requested the implementation of an Exchange feature within the customer return form. This feature requires adding Exchange as a preferred outcome option, a flow for selecting replacement products/variants (with real-time availability and price difference handling), merchant dashboard integration for approval, confirmation emails, and eligibility controlled by rules. The engineer has just started this task by planning to create the backend APIs for the exchange functionality.
