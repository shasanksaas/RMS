The AI engineer successfully completed the initial Exchange feature, including both backend and frontend components. The primary focus then shifted to debugging and stabilizing the Shopify integration, which presented numerous challenges. Key issues addressed included persistent OAuth flow failures (incorrect redirect URIs, tenant ID mismatch, non-persistent encryption keys), Shopify API permission limitations for protected customer data, and inaccurate data backfill/counting. The engineer systematically identified that REST API calls were blocked and successfully pivoted to using Shopify's GraphQL API for order and return data synchronization. Subsequent debugging cycles involved correcting a tenant ID mismatch in integration records, fixing token decryption issues, and resolving Python  errors in data processing and status counting logic. The work concluded with functional Shopify integration, successful order and return data syncing, and a comprehensive  update.

The application is a multi-tenant Returns Management SaaS platform for e-commerce, designed primarily for integration with Shopify. It features distinct customer and merchant portals. Merchant onboarding involves Shopify OAuth, which automatically provisions tenants, saves access tokens, registers necessary webhooks, and performs a 90-day data backfill of orders and returns, redirecting the merchant to their dashboard. A Tenant Management System allows administrators to create and manage tenants and their associated merchant users, underpinned by robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). The merchant dashboard's fixed entry point is .

Current key features implemented or in progress include:
1.  **Comprehensive Policy Management System**: A functional, UI-configurable rules/workflow engine. This system handles policy zones, return windows, product eligibility, return outcomes (refunds, exchanges, store credit), advanced workflow automation, fraud detection, shipping, communication, reporting, and integrations. The backend is largely complete, and a comprehensive frontend UI was recently implemented.
2.  **Customer Return Form Exchange Feature**: This feature integrates an Exchange option into the customer return flow, enabling sub-flows for selecting replacement products/variants, real-time availability checks, and handling price differences. The merchant dashboard is designed to display Exchange Requested statuses, allowing for approval that triggers a new Shopify order. Confirmation emails are sent to customers, and exchange eligibility is governed by merchant-defined rules. The customer form also incorporates a floating UI effect. This feature's backend and frontend implementation are now complete.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed critical issues preventing Shopify data synchronization, after completing the Exchange feature. The primary challenge was the Shopify integration, specifically fixing the OAuth flow and data backfill.

Initially, Shopify API permissions were a major roadblock, causing  errors for protected customer data via REST API. The engineer successfully pivoted to using Shopify's GraphQL API, resolving this.
Key issues addressed during the Shopify integration debugging:
1.  **OAuth Flow Failures**: Corrected persistent issues where the app wouldn't register as connected or tokens were invalid. This involved:
    *   Adding  to  for persistent token encryption.
    *   Ensuring the OAuth flow correctly embeds the existing tenant ID.
    *   Resolving  errors during OAuth callback by making  and  optional in  model.
    *   Fixing a tenant ID mismatch where the OAuth process was creating integrations for the wrong tenant, by manually correcting the database record.
    *   Resolving  decryption issues by ensuring a fresh OAuth flow after disconnect/reconnect and properly handling the .
    *   Correcting the  and  in  files to match the preview environment URL, then reverting them as per user's final instruction.
2.  **Data Synchronization**: Debugged why order and return counts were zero despite a connected status.
    *   Identified and fixed  errors in  during GraphQL data processing for orders and returns, enabling successful storage of Shopify orders (6 orders synced).
    *   Rectified an issue in  where the returns count was incorrect because it was filtering by wrong  values;  was added to the filter.
    *   Fixed a  error in 's  endpoint, enabling the API to fetch returns correctly.

The current state is that the Shopify integration is functional, successfully syncing 6 orders and 1 return via GraphQL. The  button now works, and API endpoints for orders and returns are operational. The main user-reported issue of returns not showing is largely resolved, although a minor  count discrepancy in the status endpoint was noted as unresolved but not blocking core functionality. The last explicit user request was to update the  with detailed information on the current state, which has been completed.
