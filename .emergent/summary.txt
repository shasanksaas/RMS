The previous AI engineer's work trajectory can be divided into several critical phases. Initially, the focus was on establishing a robust, multi-tenant application with comprehensive user and tenant management, including Shopify and Google OAuth. This foundational work also involved resolving persistent frontend state and redirect issues.

A significant portion of the recent trajectory was dedicated to addressing user-reported regressions and implementing core features. This included fixing an admin login redirection bug, implementing a real-time tenant management system with admin impersonation, and restoring the integrity of the main merchant portal (). A persistent challenge involved the customer-facing return form redirecting to the merchant dashboard, which was resolved by removing  from customer flow routes.

Subsequently, the engineer pivoted to implementing a dual-path login UI (Shopify OAuth and Email/Password). This effort was plagued by frontend caching/compilation issues,  double-execution, and confusing UI. Once these were resolved, critical security issues arose, including an admin portal accessibility bug and a tenant data leakage problem due to hardcoded tenant IDs. Both were meticulously fixed using dynamic tenant identification. The latest focus shifted to ensuring full Shopify integration, including real data backfill, webhook processing, and resolving persistent OAuth routing conflicts and external Shopify app configuration issues (e.g.,  not whitelisted, CSRF, App under review). The current work is centered on resolving conflicting backend API routers, specifically for returns endpoints, to ensure data visibility.

The application is a multi-tenant Returns Management SaaS platform for e-commerce, designed to integrate primarily with Shopify. It features customer and merchant portals, Shopify OAuth for seamless merchant onboarding, real-time data synchronization via webhooks, a configurable rules engine, and analytics. Strict multi-tenancy is enforced to prevent data leakage. Initial requirements included a complete user management system (email/password, Google OAuth) and a strict Tenant Management System, allowing admins to create tenants and merchants to sign up via . Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures distinct access levels. A key feature is Single-Click Shopify OAuth Login for merchants to authenticate, auto-provision/attach a tenant, save encrypted Shopify tokens, register webhooks, backfill 90 days of data, and redirect to their dashboard without separate signup steps. Admin access must remain a separate email/password portal. The Main Portal () is considered a sacred, unchangeable core destination for merchants post-login. More recently, the user required creating real tenant accounts from the admin dashboard with associated user logins, ensuring strict data isolation per tenant, and a 100% functional Shopify integration with real-time data flow.

<code_architecture>

The application follows a full-stack architecture with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend, interacting with a MongoDB database.
-   : The main FastAPI application. This file registers all API routers and configures middleware.
    -   Changes: Adjusted middleware order, included new , , . Critically, conflicting  and multiple Shopify/returns routers were identified and cleaned up to ensure correct routing. New integration endpoints for Shopify status and resync were registered.
-   : Middleware enforcing data isolation.
    -   Changes: Updated to exclude new Shopify OAuth and webhook paths.
-   : New FastAPI endpoints for admin tenant management.
    -   Changes: Enhanced the  endpoint to also create a merchant user account with email/password, along with the tenant.
-   : Pydantic models for tenant administration.
    -   Changes:  model was updated to include fields for email and password for creating an associated user during tenant creation.
-   : Business logic for Shopify OAuth.
    -   Changes:  was enhanced to fetch real Shopify orders/returns. Webhook registration logic was verified.
-   : Handles Shopify OAuth initiation and callback.
    -   Changes: Added new  and  endpoints. Fixed a critical bug where integration endpoints were hardcoded to . The  endpoint was updated from a placeholder to call real data sync functions.
-   : Main React router.
    -   Changes: Removed  from customer return flow routes. Simplified login routing.
-   : Main entry point for the React app.
    -   Changes:  wrapper was temporarily removed to resolve a double-execution bug affecting the OAuth button.
-   : Primary login component.
    -   Changes: Implemented a modern dual-path (Shopify OAuth / Email) tabbed interface. Was heavily debugged for frontend caching, environment variable reading ( vs ), event handling (, , ), and UI clarity (renaming tab button). Previously bypassed  and manually stored data, which was fixed to use .
-   : Enforces role-based access.
    -   Changes: Modified to prevent incorrect redirects to  after logout by checking if the target path is a login page.
-   : Contains logout functionality.
    -   Changes: Modified to redirect all logouts to  using  to bypass  interference and ensure a consistent logout experience.
-   : Layout for the admin portal.
    -   Changes: Enhanced with modern UI elements and integrated  for logout.
-   : Layout for merchant portal.
    -   Changes: Verified to already include  for logout.
-   : Admin modal for tenant creation.
    -   Changes: Enhanced to include email and password fields for creating an initial merchant user.
-   : Admin interface for tenant management.
    -   Changes: Modernized its UI with card-based layouts and improved styling.
-   : Displays all returns for a merchant.

-   Fine-tune impersonation banner display (minor aesthetic issue).
-   The current  is named  in the directory structure, which might lead to confusion and is worth reviewing.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into ensuring the Shopify OAuth and data mapping work flawlessly and without data leakage for new tenants. The user had explicitly requested to fix the OAuth flow completely and ensure real data flows into the application after a merchant connects their Shopify store via the Integrations dashboard.

The previous actions involved:
1.  **Implementing real data backfill and resync**: The  and  functions in  and  were updated to actually fetch and store real orders and returns from Shopify, replacing placeholder logic.
2.  **Verifying webhook handlers**: Confirmed that  correctly processes incoming Shopify webhooks and stores data with proper tenant isolation.
3.  **Fixing critical tenant data leakage**: A major issue was resolved where several frontend components (, , , ) had hardcoded  IDs. These were updated to dynamically fetch the tenant ID from the authenticated user's context, ensuring strict tenant isolation.
4.  **Addressing OAuth routing conflicts**: Multiple conflicting Shopify-related routers were identified in  and cleaned up to ensure only the correct ones are active.
5.  **Fixing hardcoded tenant ID in OAuth controller**:  was found to still be using  for integration endpoints, which was corrected to use the dynamic tenant ID.
6.  **Ensuring correct OAuth redirect**: Confirmed that after a successful Shopify OAuth, the backend correctly redirects to . The frontend Connect Shopify button in  was also updated to use the correct OAuth install URL.

The most recent activity involves troubleshooting a  encountered during comprehensive testing of the OAuth and data mapping flow. The engineer has identified that there are **multiple returns routers** configured in  that might be conflicting. The immediate task is to clean up these conflicting routers to resolve the 404 error and ensure returns data is displayed correctly for the newly connected tenants.
