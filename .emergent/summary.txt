The previous AI engineer has meticulously developed and debugged a multi-tenant Returns Management SaaS, focusing on the Elite-Grade Returns Creation system. The work followed a Hexagonal Architecture, CQRS, and Domain Events. Initial efforts centered on Shopify OAuth and data synchronization. The recent phase involved extensive debugging of the customer return portal, resolving critical issues across the stack: frontend-backend API mismatches, React state problems,  serialization, and . The engineer systematically addressed data propagation issues from order lookup to return submission, navigating complex problems like incorrect  property access, Shopify API access token encryption, and backend Order not found errors due to database/API lookup discrepancies. The current challenge, identified at the trajectory's end, is that successfully created returns are not appearing in the merchant dashboard because the merchant API queries the wrong MongoDB collection.

<product_requirements>
The application aims to be a multi-tenant Returns Management SaaS integrated with Shopify, offering a customer return portal and a merchant dashboard. Key features include Shopify OAuth, real-time order/return synchronization, a configurable rules engine, AI suggestions, label issuance, email notifications, and analytics, all designed with strict multi-tenancy. A core focus is the Elite-Grade Returns Creation system, supporting dual-mode order lookup (Shopify-connected or fallback to local database), detailed policy preview, comprehensive return creation APIs, and admin queues. This system mandates Hexagonal Architecture, CQRS, and Domain Events for high quality. User stories encompass customer-initiated returns (Shopify integrated and manual fallback), merchant review/approval of requests, manual merchant return creation, automated rule-based decisions, live data sync, label/refund processing, robust security/tenancy, and practical merchant UX with search/filters. So far, the customer return flow for Elite-Grade Returns Creation is the primary implemented feature.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on the Elite-Grade Returns Creation system, specifically debugging the end-to-end customer return flow from the frontend portal to the backend API, focusing on the final return submission and its visibility in the merchant dashboard.

The previous critical issues addressed include:
1.  **Frontend  error**: Fixed  in  and  by adjusting frontend data mapping in  and  to use  and handle direct  access.
2.  **Order Lookup (Real-time Shopify)**: Initially, the customer portal used an old endpoint, then a database-first lookup. The user explicitly requested a *real-time Shopify API lookup*. This involved extensive debugging of the :
    *   Corrected  to properly initialize .
    *   Fixed a bug where the access token was being encrypted before use, causing 401 Unauthorized errors.
    *   Updated Shopify GraphQL query fields to match API version 2024-10.
    *   Ensured  handles  values for , , and  objects in Shopify responses.
    *   The live Shopify order lookup is now confirmed working, populating real product and customer data (e.g., Order #1001 with TESTORDER).
3.  **Return Creation Order Not Found (Backend 500)**: After the frontend started sending correct Shopify order IDs, the backend  failed with Order not found.
    *   **Root Cause**: The backend command handler was trying to retrieve the order from MongoDB via , but the real-time Shopify orders were *not* being synced to the local database for the create flow.
    *   **Fix**: Modified  to call  (a new method added to fetch orders directly from Shopify via GraphQL) if the order isn't found in the local database.
    *   **Further Fixes**: Added  to  and subsequently to  to ensure proper hexagonal architecture flow. Corrected , , and  data formats being sent from the frontend .

**Current State of the Product**:
The customer portal now successfully looks up Shopify orders in real-time, displays live product data, and the return creation process successfully sends data to the backend API. The backend processes the return creation command, and the  successfully saves the return to the  MongoDB collection.

**The specific nuance immediately before this summary**:
Despite successful return creation and saving to , the user reported that the returns are *not* appearing in the merchant dashboard. Investigation revealed that the  (which powers the merchant dashboard) is currently querying the  collection, while new returns are saved to the  collection. There is a confirmed mismatch in the collection names.

<optional_next_step>
Modify  to query the  collection instead of  to display created returns in the merchant dashboard.
