The AI engineer's work spanned several critical phases. Initially, the focus was on establishing a robust multi-tenant SaaS application leveraging Hexagonal Architecture, CQRS, and Domain Events, with core Shopify OAuth integration. The bulk of the previous phase, as summarized in the initial trajectory message, involved extensive debugging and implementation for the Elite-Grade Returns Creation system, resolving complex frontend-backend mismatches, data propagation issues, and Shopify API integration.

Upon handover, the user immediately reported critical performance bottlenecks and data incompleteness in the returns section. The AI engineer pivoted to address these, successfully optimizing the backend API (N+1 query fix, indexing, caching) and rectifying frontend data display. This included removing static data, ensuring real-time Shopify synchronization for customer details, and fixing a persistent React rendering error in the return detail view. A significant addition was the Live Shopify Order link, directly verifying dynamic data. The final reported issue was duplicate entries on the main returns page, which the engineer is currently investigating and fixing by refining frontend display logic and data filtering.

<product_requirements>
The application is a multi-tenant Returns Management SaaS designed for e-commerce, primarily integrating with Shopify. Key features include a customer return portal, a merchant dashboard, Shopify OAuth, real-time order/return synchronization, a configurable rules engine, AI suggestions, label issuance, email notifications, and analytics, all built with strict multi-tenancy. A core component is the Elite-Grade Returns Creation system, supporting Shopify-connected and local database order lookups, detailed policy previews, comprehensive return creation APIs, and admin queues. This system emphasizes Hexagonal Architecture, CQRS, and Domain Events for high quality. User stories encompass customer-initiated returns, merchant review/approval, manual merchant return creation, automated rule-based decisions, live data sync, label/refund processing, robust security/tenancy, and practical merchant UX. So far, the customer return flow for Elite-Grade Returns Creation and its visibility/detail in the merchant dashboard is the primary implemented feature, now fully functional with dynamic Shopify data.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing two critical user issues: the return section is very very slow, also inside return details seems there is static or incomplete data with no customer and email or relevant data showing, and later, if i submit the form as customer it should in return instantly no exception and the second is pls all th mock data only real data from shopify should be visible, and showing aan error occured if clicking on eye button, and finally lot of duplicates pls fix that and again no static data striclty all dynamic real live data on the main returns page.

The work done includes:
1.  **Performance Optimization**: Identified N+1 query issues in  and . Implemented batch fetching for order data and added MongoDB indexes using  for  and  collections. This drastically reduced the returns page load time from 2-5 seconds to milliseconds.
2.  **Data Completeness (Merchant Dashboard)**:
    *   Ensured  correctly fetches and maps customer names (handling flattened Shopify data) and order numbers from Shopify GraphQL.
    *   Cleaned up all mock data from the  MongoDB collection, ensuring only real Shopify-synced returns are displayed.
3.  **Customer Submission Flow**: Verified the  and frontend () for return creation, confirming instant, exception-free submissions with real data.
4.  **Return Detail View (Eye Icon) Fix**:
    *   Addressed an Objects are not valid as a React child JavaScript error in  by correctly parsing and rendering the  object and  fields.
    *   Rebuilt the  UI to be completely dynamic, fetching all information (customer details, product info, price breakdown, timeline, shipping) from the backend API.
    *   Enhanced  to provide all necessary fields for the comprehensive detail view, and added new backend endpoints for status updates, comments, refunds, labels, and emails.
    *   Added a Live Shopify Order section in  with a dynamic link to the actual Shopify admin order page, pulling the  dynamically from the backend.
5.  **Duplicate Returns Page Entries**: The user reported duplicates on the  page. The AI engineer verified the backend API is not returning duplicates and is currently investigating the frontend display logic in , specifically how it renders the list and filters data, to ensure no duplicates are shown and all data remains dynamic.

The product now has a fully functional Elite-Grade Returns Creation system with optimized performance, complete and dynamic data display in both the main returns list and the detailed view, and a working customer submission portal. The  has been comprehensively updated. The immediate issue is fixing duplicates in the merchant's  view.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue fixing the duplicate entries on the main returns page by adding initial load and ensuring proper data filtering in .
