The AI engineer successfully transformed a basic multi-tenant SaaS application into a robust system with fully functional Elite-Grade Returns Creation and real-time Shopify synchronization. Initial work focused on fixing critical performance bottlenecks, resolving static/incomplete data issues in the merchant dashboard, and addressing persistent duplicate entries. This involved deep dives into backend N+1 queries, MongoDB indexing, frontend rendering logic, and API consistency. Subsequent efforts expanded to implementing comprehensive two-way sync for return statuses, dynamically updating amounts and item details from Shopify, and ensuring data accuracy across both merchant and customer portals. The engineer meticulously fixed multiple discrepancies between backend API responses and frontend expectations. Most recently, the focus shifted to building a complete user management system with Google OAuth, where core backend components and database setup are already complete, and frontend development has just begun.

The application is a multi-tenant Returns Management SaaS platform for e-commerce, primarily integrating with Shopify. Its core purpose is to streamline return processes for merchants and customers. Key features include a customer-facing return portal, a merchant dashboard for managing returns, Shopify OAuth integration, real-time order and return synchronization, a configurable rules engine, AI suggestions, label issuance, email notifications, and analytics, all built with strict multi-tenancy. The Elite-Grade Returns Creation system is a central component, supporting Shopify-connected and local database order lookups, detailed policy previews, comprehensive return creation APIs, and admin queues. The architecture emphasizes Hexagonal Architecture, CQRS, and Domain Events for high quality and maintainability. User stories cover customer-initiated returns, merchant review/approval, manual merchant return creation, automated rule-based decisions, live data synchronization, label and refund processing, robust security/tenancy, and a practical merchant user experience. The customer return flow and its visibility/detail in the merchant dashboard are currently implemented and fully functional with dynamic Shopify data.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with building a complete, production-ready user management structure for the SaaS platform, explicitly including login with Google too easily. This new task follows a series of successful fixes for the core returns management system:

1.  **Duplicate Returns Fix**: Identified and resolved actual duplicate entries in the MongoDB backend by implementing deduplication logic in  (case-insensitive email matching) and providing a cleanup script. Frontend display logic in  was simplified as backend now handles deduplication.
2.  **API Connectivity & Shopify Link Fix**: Resolved Unable to connect to server issues due to an improper database connection change and fixed broken Shopify order links by correcting  extraction from the Shopify integration in .
3.  **Status Update & Two-Way Sync**: Fixed Failed to update status errors by correcting MongoDB update queries in . Implemented full bidirectional status synchronization between the app and Shopify via webhooks, including loop prevention, status mapping (e.g., app APPROVED to Shopify open), and comprehensive audit logging.
4.  **Dynamic Data Display (Amounts, Reasons, Items)**: Ensured that return item amounts, reasons, and actual line items dynamically update and display correctly from Shopify data. Backend APIs () were enhanced to include  and precise  amounts. Frontend  was updated to correctly interpret and display these fields, handle status casing, and show product names instead of No items.
5.  **Customer Portal Data Accuracy**: The customer-facing return confirmation/status pages (, ) were completely refactored to fetch and display real Shopify data, replacing all static/mock information and ensuring correct tenant ID usage.

The system now has a stable, highly synchronized returns management core. The current work has just begun on the **User Management structure**:
-   **Backend (Phase 1 complete)**: New MongoDB collections (, ) with appropriate schemas () and indexes () have been defined. Core backend services () and FastAPI controllers () are created. Necessary environment variables for authentication (SECRET_KEY, Google OAuth credentials) and Python dependencies have been added and installed.
-   **Frontend (Phase 2 initiated)**: Initial React components for  and  have been created. The next step is to implement the Google OAuth callback handler and complete the remaining authentication components.
