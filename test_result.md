CRITICAL FINDINGS: Backend is serving 12 duplicate return records for the same order (1001) + customer (shashankshekharofficial15@gmail.com). This is NOT a frontend rendering issue - the MongoDB 'returns' collection contains actual duplicate documents with different UUIDs but identical business data. Timeline shows all duplicates created within 5 hours during development/testing. ROOT CAUSE: Backend data insertion process is creating multiple return records for same order+customer combination without proper deduplication. IMPACT: User correctly reports 'lot of duplicates' because API literally returns 12 returns for same order. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: (1) Implement business rule validation to prevent multiple returns per order (2) Add deduplication logic in API response (3) Clean up existing duplicate data in MongoDB (4) Add unique constraints on order+customer combinations. This is a critical data integrity issue requiring urgent backend fixes."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

PRIORITY TESTS: 1. Enhanced Tenant Creation API - Test POST /api/admin/tenants with new fields (email, password, notes), verify tenant record created in tenants collection, verify merchant user account created in users collection with hashed password, test validation for email format, password strength, test conflict handling for duplicate tenant_id or email. 2. User Account Login Verification - After creating tenant with email/password, test login with those credentials, test POST /api/users/login with created email/password/tenant_id, verify JWT token generation and role assignment (merchant), confirm login redirects to merchant dashboard. 3. Tenant Isolation - Create multiple tenants with different emails, verify each merchant can only login to their specific tenant, test cross-tenant access prevention. 4. Admin Dashboard Integration - Test tenant listing shows newly created tenants, verify tenant stats include merchant_email, test impersonation functionality with created accounts. 5. Error Handling - Test duplicate tenant_id creation (should fail), test duplicate email for same tenant (should fail), test invalid email format validation, test weak password validation. EXPECTED RESULTS: Tenant creation creates both tenant record AND user account, created user can login via /auth/login with email/password/tenant_id, each tenant is isolated with their own merchant account, admin can see and manage all created tenants, proper validation and error handling.
